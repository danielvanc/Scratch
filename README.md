# Scratch 🛠

## My default Gatsby project starter:

### Includes:

- ReactJS
- GatsbyJS
- Husky and lint-staged
- Unit Testing setup: Jest (with React
  Testing Library)
- E2E Testing setup: Cypress (with React
  Testing Library)
- Custom ES Linting: Mostly CRA
  defaults, jsx-a11y/recommended and
  linting for Jest and Cypress.
- Prettier: custom defaults
- Gatsby plugins (manifest, offline,
  react-helmet, file-system, sharp and
  transformer-sharp)
- Yarn

### What it doesn't Include

- Any CSS in JS libraries.
- Default components (other than
  header.js for the jest test examples)
- and more (to be addded).

Feel free to fork and use for your
projects 👍🏼
